  ## ðŸ’­ About <a name = "about"></a>
  A packet sniffer allows you to collect all the data that is being transmitted to and from the endpoints on the network. The advantage of collecting individual packets is that you will have an insight and detailed inspection of how certain traffic is being transmitted.
  Packet sniffers do have legitimate purposes, such as helping administrators at companies keep track of employeesâ€™ network use and protecting end users from malicious files, communications, and processes.It is an application to monitor network traffic and analyze the data of packets passing through the network.
